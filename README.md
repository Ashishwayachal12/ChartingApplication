# ChattingApplication

ChattingApplication is a simple chat application built using Java Swing, AWT, and socket programming. It enables real-time messaging between a server and  clients.

## Features

- Real-time chat between server and client.
-  clients can connect to the server.
- Simple and user-friendly GUI built using Java Swing and AWT.
- Server-client communication through sockets.
- Error handling for connection issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Java AWT**: For additional GUI components and event handling.
- **Socket Programming**: For establishing communication between the server and clients.

## How It Works

1. **Server**: The server listens on a specified port and waits for clients to connect. It relays messages between all connected clients.
2. **Client**: Each client connects to the server and can send and receive messages. Messages are displayed in the GUI.

## Setup and Installation


2.Compile the code:

Use your preferred Java compiler (e.g., javac) to compile the Server.java and Client.java files.

javac Server.java Client.java

3.Run the Server:

java Server

4.Run the Client:

java Client



#Usage:

Launch the server first, followed by multiple client instances.
Type messages in the client window, and they will be sent to the server.
The server distributes the messages to all connected clients.
